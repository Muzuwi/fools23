WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

- dumped the "mixed" instruction stream
- found some instructions in the "mixed" stream and their counterparts in the normal opcode set

WHAT IS THE RELEVANCY OF THE SECOND BYTE OF 07?
    -> IT IS IRRELEVANT, 07 enters, some other opcode leaves (presumably 08, but who knows what it is in the "mixed" encoding)
WHY DOES CREATING A PAYLOAD MANUALLY NOT WORK (while the same works in MIXTEST)?
    -> now it works after realizing above
I AM FUCKING RETARDED
    -> can confirm
